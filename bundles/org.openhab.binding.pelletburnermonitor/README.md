# PelletBurnerMonitor Binding

This binding is for communicating with pelletburners which use the NBE software.
This includes Woody, Scotty and perhaps others.
This should work as long as the pelletburner is connected to the local network through either wifi or LAN.

_If possible, provide some resources like pictures, a YouTube video, etc. to give an impression of what can be done with this binding. You can place such resources into a `doc` folder next to this README.md._

## Supported Things

Currently pelletburners with software version 13.1005 are supported.
Other versions might work also, but issues are likely to occur across major versions.

Only a subset of the readable values are currently implemented.
No writing/setting of values are implemented yet.

Verified: Woody BS+ 16kW with software version V13.1005.9

## Discovery

Discovery of pelletburner happens based on the Thing configuration.
In the simplest case only IP and serial are necessary to specify.
Broadcast discovery is not yet implemented.

## Binding Configuration

None yet.

## Thing Configuration

To configure pelletburner, create a thing-file with the following contents.
pelletburnermonitor:pelletburner_nbe_v13_1005:myburner     [ remoteaddress="W.X.Y.Z", serial="123456", refresh="9" ]

pelletburner_nbe_v13_1005 is the Thing specifying which protocol version is to be used
"W.X.Y.Z" is the IP address of the pelletburner on the local network
"123456" is the serial number of the pelletburner
"9" is the refresh interval of minutes (the time between the binding fetches data from the pelletburner)

Check the Setup part of the pelletburner screen/app for IP, software version and serial number.

### General information

The functionality of this binding has been created mainly by reverseengineering using Wireshark to figure out parts of the protocol.
Only reading of data and not writing of data is implemented, as that would require getting hold of the documentation as I don't want to risk bricking my burner.

### Adding new products/models

If it's a completely different model, it should be necessary to create a new Thing.
If it's a different software model of an already implemented model, it should be enough to create a new set of subclasses for Protocol, Request, RequestType and Response.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes the burner becomes unreachable.
In those cases it can be necessary to powercycle the burner; remove power cord from outlet, and after a few seconds reattach cord to outlet.
